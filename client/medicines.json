     "introduction": "In Treatment of Resistance Tuberculosis (TB) In multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, the causative bacteria produce an enzyme called beta-lactamase. This enzyme breaks down the antibiotics and makes them ineffective. As a result, the bacteria become resistant to the antibiotic being used for treatment. Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension comprises two active ingredients, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid. While clavulanic acid stops the enzyme from rendering amoxycillin ineffective, amoxycillin works towards killing the tuberculosis-causing bacteria. This makes the combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid an effective treatment for resistant tuberculosis. In Treatment of Bacterial infections Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension contains two different medicines, Amoxycillin and Clavulanic Acid, that work together to kill the bacteria that cause infections. Amoxycillin works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Clavulanic Acid reduces resistance and enhances the activity of Amoxycillin against bacteria. This combination medicine can be used to treat many different bacterial infections such as ear, sinus, throat, lung, urinary tract, skin, teeth, joints, and bones. It usually makes you feel better within a few days, but you should continue taking it as prescribed even when you feel better to make sure that all bacteria are killed and do not become resistant.",

Amoxycillin works by preventing the formation of the bacterial protective covering (cell wall) essential for the survival of the bacteria.

This makes the combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid an effective line of treatment for many types of infections.",

The mucus coming out of my child’s nose is yellow-green. Is it a sign of a bacterial infection?::: Yellow or green mucus in the nose does not mean that antibiotics are needed.

     "introduction": "In Treatment of Resistant Tuberculosis (TB) In multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, the causative bacteria produce an enzyme called beta-lactamase. This enzyme breaks down the antibiotics and makes them ineffective. As a result, the bacteria become resistant to the antibiotic being used for treatment. Augmentin DDS Suspension comprises two active ingredients, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid. While clavulanic acid stops the enzyme from rendering amoxycillin ineffective, amoxycillin works towards killing the tuberculosis-causing bacteria. This makes the combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid an effective treatment for resistant tuberculosis. In Treatment of Bacterial infections Augmentin DDS Suspension contains two different medicines, Amoxycillin and Clavulanic Acid, that work together to kill the bacteria that cause infections. Amoxycillin works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Clavulanic Acid reduces resistance and enhances the activity of Amoxycillin against bacteria. This combination medicine can be used to treat many different bacterial infections such as ear, sinus, throat, lung, urinary tract, skin, teeth, joints, and bones. It usually makes you feel better within a few days, but you should continue taking it as prescribed even when you feel better to make sure that all bacteria are killed and do not become resistant.",
     "how_to_use": "Augmentin DDS Suspension is an antibiotic. It has two active agents, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid. Amoxycillin works by preventing the formation of the bacterial protective covering (cell wall) essential for the survival of the bacteria. Whereas, clavulanic acid serves a special purpose of inhibiting an enzyme (beta-lactamase) that is produced by resistant bacteria. This makes the combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid an effective line of treatment for many types of infections.",
